    Having led multiple VTEX IO to FastStore migrations, I've compiled a
    comprehensive guide to help teams navigate this transition successfully.
    This post covers the key challenges, solutions, and best practices learned
    from real-world implementations.

  <h2>Why Migrate to FastStore?</h2>
  <p>
    FastStore offers significant advantages over VTEX IO, including improved
    performance metrics, better developer experience, and more flexibility in
    implementing custom features. Our team saw a 40% improvement in Core Web
    Vitals after migration.
